## *Trade-offs in Fair Redistricting* -- Online Appendix

This is the online appendix for the paper *Trade-offs in Fair Redistricting*, to appear at [AI, Ethics, and Society 2020](https://aies-conference.com).   


In the paper, we explore empirically the 'price' one must pay in terms of the compactness of districts in order to improve the partisan 
symmetry of a plan (and vice versa) in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.  Due to space constraints, we could not include all 
of the Pareto-optimal plans in the paper itself, so we include them here.  There are 13 plans for North Carolina and 25 
for Pennsylvania, including the four displayed in the paper.  Click a state below to see the plans for that state.
