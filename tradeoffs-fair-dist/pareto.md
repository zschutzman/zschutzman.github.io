## *Trade-offs in Fair Redistricting* -- Online Appendix

This is the online appendix for the paper *Trade-offs in Fair Redistricting* which is, inconveniently to you, not available as a 
preprint right now, but this website isn't linked anywhere, so...  


In that paper, we explore empirically the 'price' one must pay in terms of the compactness of districts in order to improve the partisan 
symmetry of a plan (and vice versa) in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.  Due to space constraints, we could not include all 
of the Pareto-optimal plans in the paper itself, so we include them here.  There are 13 plans for North Carolina and 25 
for Pennsylvania, including the four displayed in the paper.  Click a state below to see the plans for that state.
