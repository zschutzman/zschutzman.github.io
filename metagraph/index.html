    <summary>
      This project uses interactive widgets and visualizations to explore some of the mathematical tools used to
      analyze the mathematics of electoral redistricting, especially the question of
      <em>detecting gerrymanders</em>. We use very small
      examples to develop and demonstrate some analytical techniques.

  <main>
  

    <p>
      The nation of Gridlandia is trying to draw voting districts for its upcoming elections. The rules are that there
      must be
      four districts and each district must be made up of four contiguous units. (Basically, each district
      looks like a tetris piece.)
      Since Gridlandia is laid out neatly
      in a four-by-four grid, it's not too hard to write down all of the valid plans.
      There turn out to be only 117 of them.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>Here is one:</figcaption>
      <img src="imgs/fillgrid.png?raw=true">
    </figure>

    <p>
      We can impose a <em>graph</em> or <em> network</em> structure to organize
      the collection of all of those 117 districting options.
      We'll let each valid plan be represented by a node in this network, and we'll
      connect two nodes with an edge if the plans they represent
      are related by a simple <em>swap move</em>, exchanging the district assignments
      of two cells from adjacent districts.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <img src="imgs/fillgrid.png?raw=true">
        <img src="imgs/showswapgrid.png?raw=true">
        <img src="imgs/swapgrid.png?raw=true">
      </div>
      <figcaption>
        We can transfom the plan on the left into the plan on the right by swapping the
        colors of two cells, shown in gray in the middle image.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We call this structure the <strong>metagraph of districting plans</strong>.
      ("Metagraph" because it is a graph whose nodes represent ways of partitioning another graph.)
      Since Gridlandia is so
      symmetric, it
      might
      be useful to consider two districting plans to be <em>the same</em> if they are equivalent
      after a rigid motion like a rotation or a flip.
      For example,
    </p>

    <figure>
      <div>
        <img src="imgs/fillgrid.png?raw=true">
        <img src="imgs/rotgrid.png?raw=true">
      </div>
      <figcaption>
        A 90 degree rotation makes these two plans equivalent.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If we do collapse the metagraph in this way (in mathematical terms, if we quotient by the action
      of the dihedral group <em>D</em><sub>4</sub>) we are left with only 22 nodes, and we will call that
      smaller object a <em>reduced metagraph</em>.</p>

    <h3>All the ways to district Gridlandia</h3>
    <p>
      Below, you can interact with these
      mathematical objects&mdash; if your screen is big enough, they are side-by-side.
      On the left you can manipulate the full metagraph of Gridlandia.
      On the right you see the reduced metagraph where plans which are related by symmetry are merged into the same
      node, and two
      nodes are linked by an edge if any two of their representatives are adjacent in the full metagraph. Mouse over a
      node in
      the left-hand graph to see the corresponding plan and highlight all of the other nodes corresponding to
      symmetrically equivalent plans.
      Click a node to highlight all of its neighbors. Clicking a node in the right-hand graph will highlight
      all nodes in that symmetry class from the larger graph, plus their neighbors.</p>
    <div id="chart1" class="chart center"></div>

    <p> Nodes in the full metagraph are sized according to their degree, or number of neighbors. Nodes in the
      reduced metagraph are sized according to the number of representatives in that symmetry class.</p>

    <h3>Elections in Gridlandia</h3>
    <p>
      Now let's think about voting in Gridlandia. Gridlandia has plurality elections and two political parties, the
      <span class="purple">Purple</span> Party and the <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      Party. For simplicity, we'll start by assuming that everyone in the same grid unit votes the same
      way&mdash;either for
      the
      <span class="purple">Purple</span> candidate or the <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      candidate. Within each district, the party with the most votes wins the election, and ties are left
      ambiguous&mdash;nobody wins. Below, you can click each grid unit to toggle its vote between the parties.
      On the left, the nodes in the metagraph will change color
      to indicate which party wins a legislative majority under the corresponding plan. A node will remain gray if
      it has the same
      number of <span class="purple">Purple</span>- and <span class="orange">Orange</span>-favoring
      districts.</p>

    <div id="chart2" class="chart center"></div>

    <p>
      Let's make things a little more complicated. Instead of each unit voting entirely for one party, we will give
      it a balance of
      <span class="purple">Purple</span> and some <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      supporters, in 10% increments. The same electoral rules apply.
      Left- or right-click on each unit to adjust the
      balance of <span class="orange">Orange</span> and <span class="purple">Purple</span> supporters.</p>

    <p>
      Play around with this!
    </p>
    <p>

      - What happens when the <span class="orange">Orange</span> party has a slight majority in most of the
      cells but a few are heavily <span class="purple">Purple</span>?
    </p>
    <p>
      - Can you find a distribution of voters where one party has less than half of the votes but
      still wins three out of four districts?
    </p>
    <p>
      - Can you find a distribution of voters that creates
      a <span class="purple">Purple</span>-colored metagraph node surrounded entirely by <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      nodes?
    </p>

    <div id="chart3" class="chart center"></div>

    <p>
      If we're interested in studying redistricting in the real world, we'll need techniques that work on much, much
      more complicated graphs. We will develop some of these techniques using the 5x5 grid, which has a much
      larger universe of valid districting plans.
