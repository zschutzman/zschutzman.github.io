<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top:10px" > About Me </h2>

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [CIS Department](http://cis.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Aaron Roth](http://cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth).  This fall, I will join the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu) as a Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow. If you're in/around Boston and interested in talking about or collaborating on projects at the interface of algorthm design, data analysis, and game theory with societal issues like unfairness, discrimination, and injustice, feel free to get in touch.


I like to think about game theory, learning theory, algorithmic fairness, and computational social science. I like to think about how strategic agents, algorithmic processes, and social norms come together and interact, both mathematically and practically.


My current work examines social considerations of algorithmic outputs in a variety of contexts, including how differentially private census statistics might offer different levels of privacy protection for members of different demographic groups, the design of consumer financial products which can fairly serve customers with diverse risk tolerances, and the effects of using automated procedures to draw electoral districts on the representativeness of the elected slate of candidates.

At Penn, I am affiliated with the [CS Theory Research Group](http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/index.html), the [Warren Center for Network & Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu/), and the [Penn Research in Machine Learning (PRiML)](https://priml.upenn.edu/) group.
I have also worked with the [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group](http://mggg.org) at MIT and Tufts and was on the faculty for their 2019 [Voting Rights Data Institute](https://gerrydata.org) summer program.


Before coming to Penn, I was an undergrad at [Colby College](http://colby.edu) in beautiful Waterville, Maine.  I graduated with a double major in [mathematics](http://colby.edu/math) and [economics](http://colby.edu/econ) and a [computer science](http://colby.edu/cs) minor.
