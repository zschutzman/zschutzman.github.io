<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top:10px" > About Me </h2>

I've recently completed a postdoc at MIT and have taken a job outside of academia. If you have research questions in the area of algorithmic fairness, data privacy and reconstruction attacks, or redistricting, have a question about one of my papers or projects, or need to get in touch for any other reason, please feel free to send a message to zschutzman \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com.



At MIT, I was a Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu) with an appointment in the Schwartzman College of Computing's intiative for [Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/).  



My work examines social considerations of algorithmic outputs in a variety of contexts, including how differentially private census statistics might offer different levels of privacy protection for members of different demographic groups, the design of consumer financial products which can fairly serve customers with diverse risk tolerances, and the effects of using automated procedures to draw electoral districts on the representativeness of the elected slate of candidates. Other work has examined algortihmic fairness, game theory and strategic behavior, and mathematical optimization.

I completed my PhD in the [CIS Department](http://cis.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Aaron Roth](http://cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth).  At Penn, I was affiliated with the [CS Theory Research Group](http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/index.html), the [Warren Center for Network & Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu/), and the [Penn Research in Machine Learning (PRiML)](https://priml.upenn.edu/) group.


I have also worked with the [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group](http://mggg.org) at MIT and Tufts and was on the faculty for their 2019 [Voting Rights Data Institute](https://gerrydata.org) summer program.


Before Penn, I was an undergrad at [Colby College](http://colby.edu) in beautiful Waterville, Maine.  I graduated with a double major in [mathematics](http://colby.edu/math) and [economics](http://colby.edu/econ) and a [computer science](http://colby.edu/cs) minor.
