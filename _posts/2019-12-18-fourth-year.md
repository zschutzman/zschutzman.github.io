    I'm seven semesters in, and everything/nothing has changed.
---

More than two-and-a-half years ago, I wrote [a post](../first-post) basically to prove to myself 
and the search engine crawlers that I had survived the first year of graduate school.  Let me update you: 
I'm seven semesters in, and still going.  I feel like I'm doing okay, but that kind of thing is really 
hard to judge, since I'm basically just doing research full-time. This is good: grad school is (mostly) 
about learning to do good research and I don't know that I'm *good at doing research* but I'm certainly 
*getting better at doing research*.  On the other hand, research doesn't have the same meta-structure as 
coursework: timeframes are less rigid, there's no "set amount" of work to do, old stuff doesn't just 
evaporate in December/May, and the feedback system (peer review) is infrequent and high-stakes. I'd 
like to do a post on my experience with the peer review system as a grad student, and maybe I'll have 
some time to do that over the holiday.

When last we spoke, dear Google indexer, I was in the middle of my 
first research project, which turned into our paper on [strategic classification](../ec18-stratclass).  
Since then, I've written seven more papers: four are published, two are currently in the review process 
(and available on arXiv), and one was just accepted and will be published in February.  I'm 
thinking I can write three more by August (when I update my CV to say I'm a **fifth-year** student). While 
setting goals in terms of numbers of papers rather than in terms of learning something new, discovering some 
result, or completing a project feels like an unhealthy thing to do, I also don't think that this is an 
unreasonable goal.

In that intervening 
time, my interests have shifted from the things I described a brief [30 months ago](../first-post).  Looking 
back, I think it's fun to be able to read that and then write what I'm about to write, and I'm looking forward 
to doing it again in a few years (this does seem to be the kind of excercise which becomes less valuable if 
done too frequently). I'll certainly have to do it when I put together my research statement when I start looking for 
jobs.



Because the last time I did this, I had minimal "real" research experience, and the topics were 
fittingly vague and broad.  I think my interests are still pretty broad relative to other people 
in my position.  Figuring out how to make that breadth a strength rather than a liability has been a 
big challenge, and it will be interesting to see how that shakes out, going forward. So, without 
further ado, here is my new-and-improved answer to *what exactly it is I do*.


#### 1. Algorithmic Game Theory
Algorithmic game theory is poorly defined in a really nice way. I think about it as the study 
of systems in which strategic agents and algorithmic processes interact.  Sometimes, those 
strategic agents *are* algorithmic processes and so there's a good amount of overlap between 
"economics" game theory and "computer science" game theory.  I'm interested in settings where 
a strategic agent might misrepresent their features in order to get some favorable outcome 
from an algorithm, as in the strategic classification paper; problems arising from individuals 
who might strategically obscure their information to protect their own privacy, as in our 
[private beauty contest paper](../ec19-privacykbc); and strategic behavior in election mechanisms, 
including models of candidates trying to capture voteshare and in voters trying to manipulate 
outcomes.



#### 2. Algorithms and Society
Designing algorithms which incorporate social norms like fairness is a research area which has 
sprung up in the last decade.  In short, research in this line asks how we can 
design algorithms which satisfy a rigorous definition of *fairness* (such as not making more mistakes 
on members of Group A than we do on members of Group B), and we did this in our 
[fair allocations paper](../fat19-fairalloc). Along with this, we should be looking at how individuals 
might be harmed by algorithmic systems and investigate *who* pays this price, taking a more holistic 
view than can be captured by whatever operationalization the dataset or model uses.  My paper at AIES 
on [fair districting](../../tradeoffs-fair-dist) looks at this a little bit, and one thing that comes out 
of that paper is the observation that trying to draw congressional districts in Pennsylvania to 
be as compact as possible makes access to representation more difficult for Democrats than Republicans, 
despite drawing districts based on a neutral criterion being ostsensibly "fair".



#### 3. Computational Redistricting
Beyond the AIES paper, I've done a ton of work on computational and mathematical methods in 
the setting of redistricting.  This includes coauthoring three other academic papers, contributing to 
research and reports, working on [software](https://github.com/mggg/gerrychain), making [general audience materials](https://mggg.org/metagraoh) introducing 
[some of these concepts](https://mggg.org/distflow), and mentoring students at the 2019 Voting 
Rights Data Institute.  In the wake of major court cases and reforms, a renewed popular and 
academic interest, and in preparation for the 2021 nationwide redistricting cycle, this is a 
timely and impactful subject and I'm excited to continue thinking about how computer science can 
make meaningful contributions toward improving representation and voting rights, especially 
for those who have been denied such things as a result of formal and informal modes of discrimination.
