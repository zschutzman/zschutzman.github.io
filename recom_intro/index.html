        This project uses interactive widgets and visualizations to introduce 
        our novel method of performing Markov chain Monte Carlo random walks,
        which we call <em>Recombination</em> or <em>ReCom</em>, for short.
        This technique was first outlined in the <a href=https://mggg.org/VA-report.pdf>
          MGGG report <em>Comparison of Districting Plans for the Virginia 
          House of Delegates</em></a> and developed from work at the

        <section>
          <p>
            Let's suppose our fictional state of Gridlandia, which is nicely laid out 
            in a 20-by-20 grid needs to draw four geographically connected electoral 
            districts of equal size (each consisting of 100 squares). The legislature 
            has decided to implement the below plan, where each of the four districts 
            is a 5-by-10 arrangement of grid cells horizontal stripes across the state.
          </p>

          <section class="chart center" id='grid'></section>

          <p>
            As part of the 
            redistricting process, the Gridlandians would like to use Markov chain 
            Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to generate a large ensemble of possible plans 
            so they can be confident that the plan implemented doesn't treat any 
            groups unfairly.  As designers of the MCMC tool, we'd like for the sample 
            of plans generated to be very diverse; it wouldn't be good if we only compared 
            the chosen plan to a bunch of other very similar plans.  We therefore would 
            like the MCMC algorithm to <em>move quickly</em> through the <em> space of 
            all plans</em> so that we can gather a diverse sample without needing to 
            run the program for an impossible amount of time.
          </p>


          <p>
            The main way we affect how the algorithm moves through the space is with 
            the <em>proposal function</em>.  Basically, the proposal function looks 
            at the current plan and uses it to figure out what the next plan 
            along the chain should be, using some randomness.  The first proposal 
            to consider is what we call the "swap method", and it's the one introduced 
            in our (very gentle) <a href="https://mggg.org/metagraph">interactive introduction 
            to the math of redistricting</a>. The way the swap proposal works is that we choose 
            two adjacent districts (randomly) and pick a cell in each (randomly).  Then, we 
            try to move each cell to the other district, which succeeds if this results in a 
            legal plan.  If not, we try again.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div id="edgeswap"></div>
            <figcaption>
              We can transfom the plan on the left into the
              plan on the right by swapping the district
              assignments of the two cells that are grayed out in the center
              image.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Variations of this method are the standard one used in MCMC for redistricting, 
            for good reason. It's easy to understand and visualize, it's very, very fast 
            for a computer to take a step along the chain using this method, and, in general, 
            any plan can be transformed into any other plan by taking enough of these steps.

            However, a serious drawback of this method is that it often requires an enormous 
            number of steps to really explore the total universe of plans.  We can illustrate 
            this with the following example:
          </p>

          <section class="chart three-columns">
            <div><div id='swapgrid-static'></div><br /> <div id='swapgrid-final'></div>  </div>
            <div id='swapgrid-anim'></div><div style="width:35px" id="swapstepno"></div>

          </section>



          <!-- animation of a few hundred steps -->

          <p>
            This animation runs through one thousand steps of the random walk 
            with the swap proposal.  We've frozen an image of the initial 
            plan on the left and the final plan on 
            the right.  You can notice two features of this plan.  First, it doesn't 
            look all that different from the initial plan.  If we told you that we 
            constructed the plan on the right by making a few random edits to some 
            mystery plan and asked you to guess what that secret plan was, you'd 
            probably correctly guess the original one.  
            This relates to what is called 
            the <em>mixing time</em> of the Markov chain.  In brief, the mixing time 
            is the number of steps you need to take before you can't guess the mystery 
            starting plan.  We can see that the mixing time of the Markov chain 
            based on the swap proposal is much more than a few hundred steps.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second thing to notice is that the ways in which the final plan 
            differs from the original is not that the districts are substantively 
            different, but rather that the random process has caused our original 
            districts to sprout tentacles which shoot off in several directions; 
            what we might call the <em>district cores</em> remain unchanged.

            If we run a few thousand more steps, the district cores do disappear, 
            but not because the districts have new cores.  Rather, the districts 
            become entirely snakelike,.  Is there a way to somehow solve both of 
            these issues at once?  Can we conceive of a proposal function that 
            is easy to compute, rapidly changes the plan (i.e. has a small mixing time), 
            <em>and</em> favors plans which have districts that have nice, 
            sensible, plump shapes?
          </p>

          <h3>The Spanning Tree</h3>

          <p>
            While it sounds too-good-to-be-true, the answer turns out to be
            <strong>yes</strong>.  In order to explain how it works, we'll need some 
            light mathematical terminology and machinery.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, imagine a <em>graph</em> or <em>network</em> structure 
            on Gridlandia, where each square cell is associated with a 
            node, and there is an edge between two nodes if they are 
            geographically adjacent.  We call this the <em>dual graph</em>.
          </p>

          <section class="chart two-columns">
            <div id='dualgraph'></div>
            <div id='dualgraph-d'></div>
          </section>


          <p>
            A districting plan corresponds to a <em>partition</em> of this dual 
            graph; each district manifests as a <em>connected subgraph</em>.  
            In the language of graphs, We can specify a districting plan in 
            several ways.  One way is to list off the nodes in each district. 
            Implicitly, that's what we've been doing up until now; we can say 
            that this node is in the green district and that one in the purple 
            district, and so on.  A different way to give a districting plan is 
            that we can list off the <em>severed edges in the dual graph</em>.  
            If we tell you the list of all edges in the original Gridlandia 
            dual graph which go between two districts in my plan, you can delete 
            those edges and arrive at a partition of the original graph, which 
            exactly gives you the districting plan.
          </p>





          <p>

            For any connected graph, we can find a <em>spanning tree</em>
            of that graph.  A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph which 
            contains of all of the nodes in the graph and exactly enough edges 
            such that the tree is connected but it contains no cycles.




          </p>
          <section class="chart two-columns">
            <div id='graph_ex'></div>
            <div id='graph_ex-st'></div>
          </section>
          <p>

            In general a single graph may have an enormous number of spanning trees, 
            but that's okay, because we don't need to write them all down. Our proposal 
            function will need to be able to pick one randomly, and fortunately this is 
            a very easy thing to do.  One simple way to do it is to shuffle the list 
            of edges in the graph, and one-by-one, check if removing that edge disconnects 
            the graph. If so, remove it, and if not, skip it and move to the next one.  
            There are lots of other ways to randomly generate a spanning tree, and each 
            samples from a slightly different distribution. For the purposes of this 
            introduction, we aren't going to worry about exactly which procedure we use.


          </p>


          <p>
            The final thing to notice about trees is that removing a single edge 
            disconnects a tree and turns it into a collection of (at least two) 
            trees.  If our tree is a spanning tree of a graph, we can use this to 
            identify a partition of a graph into (at least two) pieces.  Some, 
            but not all, spanning trees have the property that there is an edge 
            which, when removed, identifies a partition of the graph into 
            two pieces of equal size.  See the illustration below for a graph 
            with two spanning trees, one with this property and one without.

          <h3> The ReCom Proposal </h3>
          <p>
           We can use this random spanning tree idea to create a new 
           proposal function!  First, we can pick two adjacent districts 
           and <strong>merge</strong> them in the dual graph, creating a 
           "superdistrict" which is twice as large as a regular district.  
           Then, we will draw a <strong>random spanning tree</strong> of the 
           superdistrict and <strong>cut the edge</strong> which splits it 
           into two equal-sized parts, which become the new districts.  If 
           our tree does not have the equal-size cut property, we will draw 
           a new random spanning tree until we find one that does.

           This is where we get the name <em>Recombination</em> or <em>ReCom</em>.
           We "recombine" two districts and then split them in order to create 
           a new plan.
         </p>

         <section class="chart three-columns">
          <div><div id='treegrid-static'></div><br /> <div id='treegrid-final'></div>  </div>
          <div id='treegrid-anim'></div><div style="width:35px" id="treestepno"></div>

        </section>

        <p>

          Below is an animation like the earlier one, where we run a 
          few hundred steps of the random walk, this time using the 
          ReCom proposal.  You'll notice that both of our problems 
          went away.  The plan on the right doesn't look like the 
          plan on the left and the snakey tendrils have been kept 
          under control.  In fact, we didn't even need all that 
          many steps to get to a plan which doesn't resemble 
          the original.



        </p>



        <p>

          Why does this work? Is it magic? Did we just get lucky?  
          No! There are good mathematical reasons for why ReCom 
          has both of these nice features.  

          <p>
            First, why does it move quickly 
            through the space of partitions?  During a swap step, we move 
            exactly two geographic units into different districts, but a ReCom 
            step will move <em>at least</em> two units and often quite a bit more. 
            It's possible that up to half of the units in a pair of districts will 
            be swapped, which is 100 units moving all at once.  Furthermore, ReCom 
            gives a wider range of options for plans to move to in a single step.  
            From the original plan, there are only about 2,000 different plans the 
            swap proposal can move to while ReCom has unfathomably many options.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, how does ReCom avoid making districts with lots of long 
            tendrils?  Remember, ReCom picks a random <em>spanning tree</em> 
            and a pair of districts generated from a superdistrict may be 
            realizable from more than one choice of spanning tree, often times very many choices 
            of spanning tree.  In this 
            way, ReCom favors generating districts with lots of spanning trees.  
            What kinds of districts have lots of spanning trees?  Graphs which 
            have a lot of cycles have a lot of spanning trees, and graphs with 
            few cycles (like snakey, tendrily ones!) have very few spanning trees.  
            Therefore, ReCom <em>naturally drives the MCMC process away from plans 
            which have snakey districts</em>.
